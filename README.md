# Smart Task Manager

Hey there! 👋  
This is my personal **Smart Task Manager**, a modern To‑Do app I built using **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Material UI**. I wanted something sleek, dark-themed, and actually fun to use for tracking tasks.

 **Live Demo:** [Check it out here](https://lovely-biscochitos-a514bf.netlify.app/)  
 **Source Code:** [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mohamed0155065/smart-task-manager.git)

##  What I Built

-  **Real-time Task Tracking:** Add, edit, and complete tasks instantly.  
- **Priority Levels:** I added this so you can see what's really important at a glance.  
- **Progress Visualization:** Watch your progress in real time with MUI components.  
- **Dark Theme:** Because dark mode is just cooler.  
-  **Responsive Design:** Works beautifully on both desktop and mobile.

##  Tech Stack

- **React 19** — for the front-end magic  
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — fast, clean, and easy-to-maintain styling  
- **Material UI (MUI)** — for interactive, elegant components
